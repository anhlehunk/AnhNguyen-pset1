the screenshots show the layout in landscape mode and portrait mode. 
Selecting a checkbox makes the corresponding bodypart appear on mr Potatohead.
The app starts with only the body. 
There is one normal layout, and a landscape-layout. Each layout has their own code, to respond to the orientation of the device.
In the main activity java file, is the code for checking the checkboxes and showing the bodyparts.

I did not made it in time to implement the onSaveInstanceState and the onRestoreInstanceState.
